// Package ywebsocket implements the server side of the Yjs y-websocket
// protocol as a RELAY. We don't decode CRDT updates server-side — the
// clients sort it out among themselves via Yjs's update + sync-step
// algebra. Our job :
//
//   - track rooms (one per project document)
//   - when a client joins, broadcast their incoming binary frames to
//     every OTHER client in the same room
//   - when a client emits a "sync-step-1" handshake, the existing
//     clients reply with their current state ; we don't intercept
//   - on the last client leaving, the room is GC'd (state is gone —
//     V0.1 has no persistence ; V0.2 will snapshot to weft-block)
//
// Why a relay (and not a server-side CRDT) :
//
//   - the y-protocols spec is binary + versioned ; clients evolve and
//     a relay is forward-compatible with new protocol versions for
//     free
//   - server-side state needs a Go Yjs implementation, which is a
//     several-thousand-line project on its own
//   - relay-only is the deployment mode the upstream y-websocket
//     server uses too ; persistence is bolted on by serialising the
//     last update from any one client to a backing store
//
// Concurrency : one goroutine per connection reads from the socket
// and pushes onto the hub's broadcast channel ; the hub fan-out
// goroutine pushes to every peer's send channel. Slow peers get
// dropped (we never block the hub on one straggler).
